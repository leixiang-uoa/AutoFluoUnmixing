# AutoFluoUnmixing
Removal of System-Induced Autofluorescence in Miniaturized Fiber-Optic Fluorescence Endoscopes

The current codes are designed for phantom data unmixing. To apply them to in vivo data, minor modifications are needed. Specifically, to correctly extract the raw data and convert it from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates for proper display.
